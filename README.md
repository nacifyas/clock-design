# clock-design
Small project to practise CSS &amp; JS.
The exercise is about creating a clock using CSS and JS in order to create a functional clock.

(A "finished" variant is located in branch Main, other branches are for other unfinished designs)

UPDATE-
Ended up working on a unique desing. I am big fan and owner of complicated timepieces, and I decided to go for the iconic design of putting the watch hands on the lateral of the clock. Served well as a challenge to learn CSS and JS, and as a nice looking clock.
